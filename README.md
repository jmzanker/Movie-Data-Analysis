# Introduction

For this project the TMDb movie data will be investigated. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
Since there is no further information, we assume that 'budget' and 'revenue' are in US dollars, and the dataset show the global revenues. Since we are comparing movies spanning from the 1960s up to 2015, we use the inflation-adjusted columns 'budget_adj' and 'revenue_adj'.
Questions which will need to be answered are:
1. Which genres are most popular from year to year?
2. What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
